**What the script does, step by step**

**1) Configuration & caching**

Event selection: EVENT_NAME = "Monza" (change to “Hungary”, “Belgium”, etc.).
Training span: TRAIN_YEARS = 2018..2024.
Target prediction year: PREDICT_YEAR = 2025.
Caching: Enables a local FastF1 cache at ./fastf1_cache to avoid repeated network calls.

**2) Data loading (FastF1)**

For each season and the chosen event:
FP2 session ("FP2")
Qualifying session ("Q")
Race session ("R")
Each session is loaded via:
ev = fastf1.get_event(year, EVENT_NAME)
ses = ev.get_session("FP2" / "Q" / "R")
ses.load(laps=True, telemetry=False, weather=False)

**3) Feature engineering**

FP2 features (fp2_features)
Selects quick laps (FastF1’s pick_quicklaps()).

**For each driver, computes:**

FP2MedianLapSec: median lap time (in seconds).
FP2LapCount: count of laps used for pace estimation.
Joins key: DriverAbbr (3-letter code).
Rationale: FP2 pace + workload are robust early indicators of car/driver baseline performance for the weekend.
Qualifying features (quali_features)

**From qualifying results:**

BestQSec: the minimum of Q1/Q2/Q3 times (converted to seconds).
QualiPosition: classified position from results.
Team and a human-readable DriverName when available.
Standardizes columns and gracefully handles missing fields by creating them if absent.
Rationale: Best quali lap captures single-lap performance; quali order is a strong proxy for race grid and inherent pace.
Race target (race_target)

**From race results:**

Grid: starting grid position (if available).
FinishPos: finishing position as the prediction target.
DNFs/DSQ/DNS/DNQ/RET are pushed to the back of the grid (one position after the max valid grid), so the model learns “worse than last classified finisher” rather than treating them as missing.
Rationale: Predicting ordinal finishing position is intuitive and aligns with downstream ranking (lower is better).

**Merging**

All three sources are merged on DriverAbbr only (team strings can vary).
Final per-driver row contains:
Categorical: Team, DriverAbbr
Numeric: FP2MedianLapSec, FP2LapCount, BestQSec, Grid, Year
Target: FinishPos
Pretty label: DriverName (kept for output display, not for learning)
Cleaning & defaults
Missing numerics get safe fill values:
FP2MedianLapSec → median of available values
FP2LapCount → 0
BestQSec → median
Grid → median (or derived from QualiPosition at prediction time)
Categorical columns (Team, DriverAbbr) are cast to category dtype.

**4) Model pipeline**

**Preprocessing**

ColumnTransformer:
OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore") on Team and DriverAbbr
Numeric features (FP2MedianLapSec, FP2LapCount, BestQSec, Grid, Year) passed through
Regressor

**RandomForestRegressor**

n_estimators=600, min_samples_leaf=2, n_jobs=-1, fixed random_state
Wrapped in a Pipeline: ("pre", preprocessor) → ("rf", random forest)
Why a Random Forest?
Non-linear interactions (e.g., pace vs. grid vs. team) often matter.
Robust to mixed dtypes and moderate missingness after fills.
Handles ordinal target reasonably well (finish positions) and is stable across seasons.

**5) Cross-validation (leakage-aware)**

Uses GroupKFold where the group = Year.
This prevents training and testing on the same season, which would leak weekend-specific conditions and distort scores.
Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in finishing positions across year-held-out folds.
The script prints Year-grouped CV MAE: mean ± std.
Interpretation: MAE≈2 means predictions are, on average, ±2 positions off.

**6) Final training & prediction**

**Trains the final pipeline on all training years.**

**For PREDICT_YEAR, builds features from FP2 + Quali only:**

Fills Grid from QualiPosition (if Race hasn’t happened yet).
Applies the same cleaning & typing.
Predicts PredictedFinishPos for each driver.
Sorts drivers by predicted finish (ascending) and outputs a neat table with:
PredictedRank (1..N), DriverName, DriverAbbr, Team, Grid, BestQSec, FP2MedianLapSec, FP2LapCount, and the raw PredictedFinishPos.
Key design choices & justifications
Join key = DriverAbbr: Most stable cross-session identifier; avoids issues with name formats.
DNF handling: Mapping to “back of grid + 1” preserves order semantics and avoids dropping valuable rows.
Feature simplicity: FP2 median pace + workload, best quali lap, and grid capture the core signal without brittle micro-features that can break between seasons.
Year-grouped CV: Crucial to simulate out-of-season generalization and avoid leakage from conditions unique to a season.
One-hot categoricals: Lets the model learn team and driver-level fixed effects while still reacting to numeric signals.
Assumptions & limitations
Weather/strategy not modeled: No live strategy/weather inputs; model infers indirectly via pace & grid.
Safety cars & incidents: Unpredictable events aren’t directly captured; RF approximates average outcomes.
Quali→Grid: If official grid penalties differ from QualiPosition, predictions may drift.
Event specificity: Model is trained per event name across years (e.g., Monza history to predict Monza), which is intentional—tracks have stable characteristics.

**How to use**

**Install deps:**

fastf1, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tqdm
Set event & years at the top:
EVENT_NAME = "Monza"
TRAIN_YEARS = list(range(2018, 2024 + 1))
PREDICT_YEAR = 2025
Run after FP2 & Quali of the target year:
The script will:
build the historical dataset,
print CV results,
train the final pipeline,
predict and print the target year’s classification.

**Caching:**

First run will populate ./fastf1_cache; subsequent runs will be faster.
Output you’ll see
A dataset preview (first rows).
Year-grouped CV MAE (mean ± std).
Predicted classification table for the target year with ranks and key features.

**Extending the model (ideas)**

Add weather-adjusted pace features (e.g., dry-only laps).
Include long-run pace indicators (FP1/FP3 if desired).
Try ranking/regression objectives that penalize mis-ordering (e.g., pairwise losses).
Penalty-adjusted Grid when official penalties are known.
Model interactions (e.g., Team × Year) via target encoding or tree models with richer hyper-params.

**Why it works in practice**

By focusing on track-specific historical patterns and the strongest weekend signals (FP2 pace + quali performance + grid), the model captures a large fraction of predictable variance in race results, while the leakage-aware CV ensures we’re not fooling ourselves with optimistic scores.
